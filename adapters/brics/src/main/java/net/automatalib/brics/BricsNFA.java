 * Adapter class for wrapping a Brics automaton as an {@link NFA}.
 * <p>
 * This adapter is backed by the Brics automaton, so changes to the {@link Automaton}
 * are reflected.
 * <p>
 * As a DFA can be regarded as a special case of an NFA, using this class on a Brics
 * {@link Automaton} will always work. However, determining successor states for input
 * characters might be much less efficient than when using a {@link BricsDFA}.
